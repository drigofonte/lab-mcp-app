# MCP App Lab — Task Manager

A hands-on learning project that demonstrates the [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/apps/overview) standard (SEP-1865) through a working task manager. Built for developers evaluating what MCP Apps can do and how they differ from traditional web apps.

## What This Demonstrates

### MCP App Concepts

| Concept | How it's demonstrated |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Tool visibility modes** | 5 tools with all three modes: `list_tasks` and `get_task` (model + app), `update_task` (app-only — AI can't call it), `summarize_tasks` (model-only — no UI renders) |
| **`ui://` resource routing** | 3 distinct views (`ui://tasks/list`, `ui://tasks/detail`, `ui://tasks/create`) served as bundled HTML from a single MCP server. The AI navigates between them by calling different tools. |
| **Bidirectional context (`updateModelContext`)** | The task list sends a detailed summary to the AI (task names, statuses, counts). Ask "what am I looking at?" and the AI knows without you telling it. |
| **App-to-conversation messaging (`sendMessage`)** | Clicking a task title in the list posts a message to the chat ("Show me details for 'Fix login bug'"). The AI responds naturally with the detail view. |
| **Stage-then-confirm workflow** | Creating a task shows an editable review form before persisting. The AI proposes, the user reviews and modifies, then confirms — demonstrating bidirectional tool orchestration. |
| **Stateless UI / server-side state** | All state lives in the NestJS backend. MCP App views rehydrate from scratch on every mount — no localStorage, no session storage. |
| **Sandboxed iframe isolation** | Views run in a double-iframe sandbox (sandbox proxy on a separate origin) with CSP restrictions — the standard MCP Apps security model. |
| **Inline rendering in conversation** | MCP Apps appear inline within assistant messages using assistant-ui's `tools.Fallback` system, not in a side panel. |

### What the AI Can and Can't Do

| Action | Who can do it |
|--------|--------------|
| List tasks | AI and UI |
| View task details | AI and UI |
| Create a task | AI proposes, user confirms in UI |
| Update task status/priority | UI only (app-only tool — AI is blind to it) |
| Summarize workload | AI only (model-only tool — no UI renders) |

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, [assistant-ui](https://www.assistant-ui.com) (chat + styled components), [@mcp-ui/client](https://github.com/idosal/mcp-ui) (MCP App rendering)
- **Backend:** NestJS 11, [@rekog/mcp-nest](https://github.com/rekog-labs/MCP-Nest) (MCP server), OpenAI SDK (Ollama-compatible)
- **MCP App Views:** React 19, [@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps) (App class, useApp hook)
- **LLM:** Local Ollama (qwen3 by default, configurable)
- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v9+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running locally with a model that supports tool calling

Pull a model if you haven't:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:30b
# or: ollama pull qwen3.5:35b, llama3.3:70b
```

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the MCP App views (required before first run)
pnpm --filter mcp-views build

# Start all services (backend, frontend, sandbox proxy)
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Configuration

The backend reads from environment variables (create `apps/backend/.env` if needed):

```env
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1   # default
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3:30b                      # default
```

## Example Prompts

### Listing Tasks

> Show me all my tasks

The AI calls `list_tasks` and the task list renders inline with all current tasks.

> What am I looking at?

After the task list is visible, the AI references specific task names and counts from the current view — it "sees" the UI via `updateModelContext`.

### Creating Tasks

**Minimal (AI asks for details):**

> Create a new task

The AI sees that `title` and `description` are required but not provided, so it asks for them. Once you reply with the details, the review form appears.

**With all details (form appears immediately):**

> Create a task called "Write integration tests" with description "Add end-to-end tests for the task creation flow", high priority, status todo

The AI has everything it needs — it calls `create_task` immediately and the editable review form appears inline. Modify any field, then click "Create Task" to persist.

### Viewing Task Details

**By name:**

> Show me the details for "Design database schema"

The AI calls `get_task` and the detail view renders inline with status/priority dropdowns and a Save button.

**Conditional — check then create:**

> Do I have a task about writing documentation? If not, create one.

The AI calls `list_tasks` or `summarize_tasks` to check, then either shows the existing task or calls `create_task` to propose a new one.

### Workload Summary

> What's my workload looking like?

The AI calls `summarize_tasks` (model-only tool) and reasons about task counts and priorities. No UI renders — the response is purely conversational.

> How many high priority tasks do I have?

Similar to above — the AI uses `summarize_tasks` or `list_tasks` to answer without rendering a view.

### Multi-Step Conversations

> Show me my tasks. Now create a new one for setting up CI/CD.

The AI handles the sequence: first `list_tasks` (renders the list), then after you provide details, `create_task` (renders the review form).

> Is there anything in progress? Mark "Design database schema" as done.

The AI checks the task list, finds the task, and describes it — but it can't update status directly because `update_task` is an app-only tool. It will tell you to use the detail view's Save button instead.

## Demo Script (~5 minutes)

1. **First impression** — Open the app. Ask "show me my tasks". The task list renders inline in the chat with seed data.

2. **AI sees the UI** — Ask "what am I looking at?". The AI references specific task names and counts from the current view (via `updateModelContext`).

3. **App drives conversation** — Click a task title in the list. A message appears in the chat and the AI responds with the detail view.

4. **Create from conversation** — Ask "create a task to write unit tests, high priority". An editable review form appears. Modify fields if needed, then click "Create Task".

5. **Model-only tool** — Ask "what's my workload looking like?". The AI calls `summarize_tasks` (model-only) and reasons about it — no UI renders.

6. **App-only tool** — In the detail view, change a task's status and click "Save Changes". The `update_task` tool is app-only — the AI never sees it.

7. **Stateless UI** — Refresh the page. The UI rehydrates from server state — no localStorage, no session.
